Number Guessing Game (Java)

A simple and fun Java console application where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

Features:
- Random number generation using Java's `Random` class.
- Real-time feedback on guesses ("Too high" / "Too low").
- Counts and displays the number of attempts taken.
- Simple console-based interface — easy to understand and run.


How It Works:
1. The program generates a random number between **1 and 100**.
2. The user is prompted to "guess" the number.
3. After each guess, the program gives hints:
   - If your guess is *too high*, it says "Too high! Try again."
   - If your guess is *too low*, it says "Too low! Try again."
4. When you guess the number correctly, it congratulates you and shows the **number of attempts** taken.
